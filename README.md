# Quantum Machine Learning experiments

This is a series of experiments in quantum, and quantum machine learning inspired by Machine Learning with Quantum Computers by Schuld and Petruccione, which I wrote for my own education.

There are Jupyter Notebooks for:
 - A very highly simplified [model](notebooks/01_Titanic.ipynb) of the Titanic disaster to predict the fate of one passenger in the mini-test set with two other passengers.
 - An [illustation](notebooks/02_Amplitude_estimation.ipynb) of Amplitude Estimation from first principles
