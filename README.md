# Quantum Machine Learning experiments

This is a series of experiments in quantum, and quantum machine learning inspired by Machine Learning with Quantum Computers by Schuld and Petruccione, which I wrote for my own education.

There are Jupyter Notebooks for:
 - A very highly simplified [model](notebooks/01_Titanic.ipynb) of the Titanic disaster to predict the fate of one passenger in the mini-test set with two other passengers from Chapter 1
 - An [illustation](notebooks/02_Amplitude_estimation.ipynb) of Amplitude Estimation from first principles based on Chapter 3
 - An [example](notebooks/03_Hopfield.ipynb) of a Hopfield network to recall saved patterns also based on Chapter 2.
